# AI-Powered Journal App

A chat-based journaling application that uses AI to help you reflect on your day, plan ahead, organize thoughts, and track goals.

## Features

- **Daily Reflection**: AI-guided conversations to help you process your day
- **Planning**: Organize thoughts for upcoming days and weeks
- **Brain Dump**: Capture and structure all your ideas and thoughts
- **Goal Tracking**: Set and review personal goals with AI assistance
- **Voice Mode**: Hands-free continuous listening for journaling while driving
- **Browse Entries**: View and filter past journal entries by date
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set up OpenAI API Key

1. Copy the example environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Edit the `.env` file and add your OpenAI API key:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_api_key_here
```

You can get an API key from [OpenAI's website](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

### 3. Run the Application

Start the FastAPI server:

```bash
python main.py
```

Or use uvicorn directly:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

### 4. Access the App

Open your web browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:8000
```

**Important for Voice Mode**: Chrome requires HTTPS for microphone access when not on localhost. Since we're running on localhost (127.0.0.1), voice mode should work properly. If you encounter microphone access issues, make sure you're accessing the app via `http://localhost:8000` or `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, not `http://0.0.0.0:8000`.

## Troubleshooting

1. **OpenAI API Errors**: Make sure your API key is valid and you have credits
2. **Database Issues**: Delete `journal.db` to reset the database
3. **Port Conflicts**: Change the port in `main.py` if 8000 is already in use
4. **Dependencies**: Make sure all packages in `requirements.txt` are installed
